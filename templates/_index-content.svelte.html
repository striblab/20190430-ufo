        <p>"My wife and I noticed what we thought was a star. It then started moving up and down, side to side and at 90 degree angles," reads a September report marked as coming from Hastings, Minn. "I have never seen anything like this before."</p>

        <p>"I was driving to work early in the morning and noticed double-layered lights surrounding a massive circular object in the sky around 494 and Minnetonka Blvd," <a href="http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/148/S148622.html" target="new_">reads another</a> from Minnetonka in August.</p>

        <p>“Just got home from buying a dirt bike for my kids and took it for a drive in the dark to the end of the driveway,” <a href="http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/146/S146583.html">described another</a> from Mora in June, “I saw a fireball looking circle moving around slightly about a half mile away, about 60 ft up, it just suddenly disappeared.”</p>

        <p>Minnesotans file nearly a hundred seemingly strange reports like these annually, all available in an online database stretching back seven decades, with increasing encounters appearing across the last ten years.</p>

        <p>This year alone has been filled with fervor around UFOs, featuring the military acknowledging "unidentified aerial objects" as real, hundreds flooding Area 51 jokingly seeking alien life, Minnesotans <a href="http://www.startribune.com/ufo-or-no-forty-years-later-a-minnesota-town-still-wonders/558012492/">celebrating the 40th anniversary</a> of the state’s most famous encounter, and scientists and media outlets <a href="http://www.startribune.com/lost-in-airspace-our-bearings-maybe-as-ufos-make-news/510938682/">paying closer attention to out-of-this-world sightings</a>.</p>

        <p>“People are looking up in the sky, people are watching and they know to report what they see,” said Tom Maher, Minnesota State Director of the Mutual UFO Network, one of the world's oldest and largest organizations of paranormal enthusiasts, which also collects local encounters.</p>

        <p>About half of Minnesota’s roughly UFO 1,700 sightings have been concentrated in this decade – perhaps not accidentally coinciding with skies increasingly crowded by human flight, including drones, planes, weather balloons, military drills and more.</p>

        <p>These reports in particular are collected by <a href="http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/ndxlMN.html" target="new_">the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC)</a>, a Washington-based organization that has investigated UFOs for nearly five decades. It also marks apparent hoaxes or incidents in its database that could have simple explanations, like casino advertising lights, lens flares or satellites sweeping through night skies.</p>

        <p>But not everything is so readily explainable, with even the Pentagon struggling to account for every strange object spotted by its pilots, including hypersonic aircraft flying at 30,000 feet against the wind and unknown shapes in recently-released military videos.</p>

        <p>“They’re not swamp gas, they’re not balloons, they’re something they can’t explain,” said Mike Harris, a field investigator in Minnesota’s MUFON chapter, whose role involves parsing everyday phenomena from the unknown.</p>

        <p>Strange lights, circles, triangles and spheres are the most commonly-submitted reports from Minnesotans, and sightings purportedly last anywhere from one second to over an hour.</p>

        <p>Harris said the increased presence of the paranormal in television shows have drawn more people’s interest to the unexplained, and acknowleged the use of drones by hobbyists and governments could also be behind some incidents.</p>

        <p>Maher described himself as a skeptic, but not a cynic, and keeps himself open to possibilities of alien life, while acknowledging many UFO sightings have other plausible explanations.</p>

        <p>Maher said MUFON collects a separate set of privately-submitted local reports, but that the group's investigators sometimes consult what publicly on appears on NUFORC .</p>

        <p>Both Harris and Maher have been involved with MUFON for years, and the group holds monthly meetups in New Brighton where attendees with diverse outlooks talk about their experiences, show videos and listen to guest speakers on a wide array of topics.</p>
  
        <p>Meanwhile, government agencies and research institutions continue to cast their electronic eyes upon the skies looking for signs we aren't alone in the universe. And earlier this year, the SETI Institute released <a href="https://technosearch.seti.org/" target="new_">a new database</a> of all its searches for extraterrestrial life since 1960. </p>

        <p>“There’s so much in the universe we don’t understand,” Maher said. “We can start going down the rabbit hole and never stop.”</p>
