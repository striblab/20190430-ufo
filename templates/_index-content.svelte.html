        <p>"My wife and I noticed what we thought was a star. It then started moving up and down, side to side and at 90 degree angles," <a href="http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/148/S148909.html" target="new_">reads a September report</a> marked as coming from Hastings, Minn., "I have never seen anything like this before."</p>

        <p>Reports of unexplained objects jetting through the sky have spiked the last few years, as spied by military and amateur onlookers, igniting excitement among UFO hunters and spurring official investigations.</p>

        <p>As the U.S. Navy releases new UFO footage this month, hundreds of people flood Area 51 jokingly seeking alien life, and scientists, academics and media outlets pay closer attention to sightings, 2019 has been filled with fervor for alleged extraterrestrial visitors.</p>
        
        <p>Minnesota too has a long history of alleged UFO sightings stretching back decades – averaging around 100 per year – and data collected by enthusiasts reveals when, where and what kinds of out-of-this-world objects residents have reported encountering.</p>

        <p>Nearly two-thirds of 1,700 Minnesota <a href="http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/ndxlMN.html" target="new_">sightings recorded by the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC)</a> have been concentrated in this decade, which is consistent with national trends.  The Washington-based organization has operated continuously since 1974 and has charted the sharp uptick in submitted reports.</p>

        <p>NUFORC QUOTE HERE</p>

        <p>Skies increasingly crowded by human flight could be driving those numbers up, as there are more planes, drones, balloons, satellites and other manmade flying objects hovering above the planetary surface than ever before in recorded history.</p>

        <p>Though while UFO hunting is often associated with the search for extraterrestrial life, just because an object might unindentified doesn't necessarily suggest alien origin.</p>

        <p>Unidentified lights, circles, triangles and spheres are the most commonly-submitted reports to NUFORC out of Minnesota. And while many reported sightings in our ever-crowded skies can be readily identified, not everything has or can be investigated or verified.</p>
  
        <p>Amid renewed hype, UFO hunters in Minnesota have revitalized their search for the unknown.</p>

        <p>UFO encounters <a href="http://www.startribune.com/lost-in-airspace-our-bearings-maybe-as-ufos-make-news/510938682/">have gained more serious attention the last two years</a>, with the Pentagon recently admitting it's paying closer attention to sightings of strange objects by military personnel, and even released raw footage of a UFO to The New York Times. Government agencies and research institutions too have long cast their electronic eyes upon the skies looking for signs we aren't alone.</p>

        <p>This year was also the 40th anniversary of Minnesota's most famous UFO sighting, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/ufo-or-no-forty-years-later-a-minnesota-town-still-wonders/558012492/">a 1979 encounter</a> by a Marshall County Sheriff's deputy in Warren, Minn.</p>
  
        <p>Whether these unknown objects are everyday vehicles, military missions, secret test projects or stellar visitors, it remains more and more reports are surfacing in the social media age than ever before.</p>
