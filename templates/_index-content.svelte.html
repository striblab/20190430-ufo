        <p>Minnesota has a long history of alleged UFO sightings stretching back decades, and data collected by enthusiasts reveals when, where and what kinds of out-of-this-world objects Minnesotans have encountered.</p>

        <p>The nearly two-thirds of 1,600 Minnesota sighting incidents recorded by the National UFO Reporting Center have primarily been concentrated in this decade, which is consistent with national trends.  The organization has operated continuously since 1974 and has noticed the sharp uptick in submitted reports.</p>

            <p>Unidentified lights, circles, triangles and spheres are the most commonly-submitted reports to NUFORC out of Minnesota.</p>

            <p>Increasingly crowded skies could be driving those numbers up, as there are more planes, drones, balloons, satellites and other manmade flying objects hovering above the planetary surface than ever before in human history.</p>

        <p>But the hunt for extraterrestrials has intensified in recent years as advanced devices watch and listen to the skies. The Pentagon too has recently admitted it's paying closer attention to sightings of strange objects by military personnel, and even released raw footage of a UFO to The New York Times a couple years ago.</p>
  
        <p>Amid this renewed hype, UFO hunters worldwide and in Minnesota have revitalized their search for the unknown.</p>
